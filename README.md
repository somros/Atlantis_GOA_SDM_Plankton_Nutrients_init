# Spatial distributions and initial biomasses of plankton and nutrients in Atlantis GOA

This code deals with plankton spatial distributions and initial conditions in Atlantis GOA. It performs three main tasks:  

1. Extract NPZ variables from NEP10K ROMS output files, per quarter of a selected year.
2. Aggregate NPZ species complexes into Atlantis functional groups and calculates seasonal spatial distributions.
3. Calculate biomass per box as average for January of the selected year, to be used in the initial conditions.
